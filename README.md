Everything is awesome, everything is cool when your part of a team
Everything is awesome, when you're living out a dream
Everything is better when we stick together
Some have said you and I are gonna win forever?
Lets party forever
We're the same unlike you, you're like me we're all working in harmony
Everything is awesome, everything is cool when your part of a team
Everything is awesome, when you're living out a dream

Woo! 3, 2, 1, go!
Have you heard the news? Everyone's talkin'
Life is good 'cause everything awesome
Lost my job, there's a new opportunity
More free time for my awesome community
I feel more awesome than an awesome possum
Dip my body in chocolate frostin'
Three years later wash off the frostin'
Smellin' like a blossom, everything is awesome
Stepped in mud, got new brown shoes
It's awesome to win and it's awesome to lose
